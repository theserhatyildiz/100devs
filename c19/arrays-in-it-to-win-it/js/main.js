//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

let movies = ['rocky','bob','jack']

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

let firstMovie = movies [0]

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

let arrLenght = [movies.lenght]
console.log(arrLenght)

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?

let lastMovie = movies [movies.length-1]


// let movies = ['Rocky', 'Goal', 'Hababam Sinifi']
// let firstMovie = movies [0]
// let arrayLenght = movies.length

// console.log(arrayLenght)
// let lastElement = movies [movies.length-1]
